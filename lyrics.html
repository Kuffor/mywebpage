        LYRICS:

        Hello? (Hello? Hello? Hello?)
        Is there anybody in there?
        Just nod if you can hear me
        Is there anyone home?

        Come on now
        I hear you're feeling down
        Well I can ease your pain
        Get you on your feet again
        
        Relax
        I'll need some information first
        Just the basic facts
        Can you show me where it hurts?

        There is no pain you are receding
        A distant ship smoke on the horizon
        You are only coming through in waves
        Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying

        When I was a child I had a fever
        My hands felt just like two balloons
        Now I've got that feeling once again
        I can't explain you would not understand

        This is not how I am
        I have become comfortably numb
        I have become comfortably numb

        Okay (okay, okay, okay)
        Just a little pinprick
        There'll be no more, ah
        But you may feel a little sick

        Can you stand up?
        I do believe it's working, good
        That'll keep you going through the show
        Come on it's time to go

        There is no pain you are receding
        A distant ship, smoke on the horizon
        You are only coming through in waves
        Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying

        When I was a child
        I caught a fleeting glimpse
        Out of the corner of my eye
        I turned to look but it was gone
        I cannot put my finger on it now
        The child is grown
        The dream is gone
        I have become comfortably numb
